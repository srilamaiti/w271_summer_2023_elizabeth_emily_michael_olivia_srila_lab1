## Description

The data-set for analyzing the risk of O-ring failure in the Challenger Space Shuttle flight consists of twenty-three (23) out of the twenty-four (24) prior launches (one launch data is not available because the motors were lost at sea). The flight number increases by increment of one and corresponds to the incremental number of the flight (increases over date-time). 

In addition to the Flight number, variables for launch temperature (**Temperature (째F)**), leak test pressure (**Pressure (psi)**), and O-ring failure mechanism (**O-Ring**) are recorded. In the O-ring failure mechanism, a value of 1 indicates erosion while a value of 2 indicates blow-by. As was the case in (Siddhartha, 1989), because only one flight (Flight Number 14) experienced secondary O-ring distress, only primary O-ring distress is considered in the analysis. The full data set accompanied with comments on the nature of the O ring failure mechanisms is presented in **Table 1**.


```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

df <- read.csv('~/271/summer_23_central/Labs/Lab_1/data/raw/challenger.csv')

# Add some other columns
df$Mechanism <- ifelse(df$O.ring==1,"Erosion",ifelse(df$O.ring==2,"Blowby",""))
df$Comment <- ifelse(df$Flight==14, "Secondary O-ring Distress Noted", "")

#head(df)
#describe(df)

```

```{r table1, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='asis'}
cols <- c("Flight","Temp","Pressure","O.ring","Mechanism","Comment")

stargazer(df[cols],type='latex', summary=FALSE, rownames=FALSE, 
          title='Twenty Three (23) Measured Flights Prior to Challenger Disaster',
          column.labels = c("Flight Number", "Temperature (째F)", "Pressure (psi)", "Primary O-Ring Failure Mechanism","Additional Comments"), 
          header=FALSE)

```

## Key Features

Evident in **Table 1** are some peculiarities corresponding to the features available in the data set. The first is that, over time, the leak test pressure changes. Dalal et al. explain that this was due to finding that the putty by itself could sustain 50 psi, so the leak test was increased to 100, and then to 200 psi to properly test for O ring capability. It's also noted, however, that this increased leak pressure may have contributed to blow holes, which can lead to erosion in the putty. The other major finding is the temperatures that were experienced leading up to the fatal Challenger flight, which was scheduled to launch with a temperature hovering around freezing (31 째F). As seen in **Table 2** explicitly, the minimum temperature experienced prior to the launch failure was 53째F. It's also seen in **Table 1** that this particular launch corresponded to the single example of secondary O ring distress and corresponded with primary O ring blow by. The presence of secondary O-ring failure is critical because it shows that this condition could lead to failure in both O rings and thus penetration of the engine gases.


```{r table2, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='asis'}
cols <- c("Flight","Temp","Pressure","O.ring")

stargazer(df[cols], type='latex', summary=TRUE, header=FALSE,
          title="Baseline Statistics of Prior Flights to Challenger Disaster")

```

The temperature effect alluded to in the data set is confirmed in **Figure 1**, which is a panel figure comparing the features and their reported Pearson correlation coefficients. It's shown that the correlation between the the temperature component and the O-ring failures is -0.51, meaning that lower temperatures were considered to result in higher O-ring failures. Also note the correlation between *Pressure* and *Flight*, which is easily explained by the change in procedure over time. To a lessor degree also exists a correlation between *Pressure* and *O ring* which may indicate a potential pressure effect to explore. This is also supported by the theory discussed above that high leak test pressure can lead to putty erosion.

# Analysis

## Reproducing Previous Analysis (10 points)

**Your analysis should address the following two questions. In your final submission, please remove this question prompt so that your report reads as a report.**

1.  Estimate the logistic regression model that the authors present in their report -- include the variables as linear terms in the model. Evaluate, using likelihood ratio tests, the statistical significance of each explanatory variable in the model. Evaluate, using the context and data understanding that you have created in the **Data** section of this report, the practical significance of each explanatory variable in the model.

From the exploratory data analysis, we found negative correlation between *Temp* and 
*O-ring* and positive correlation between *Pressure* and *O-ring*.
We want to include both explanatory features in our first logistic regression model 
to explore more.
For a given launch $i$, we denote the probability for an O-ring to fail as $\pi_i$, 
launch temperature as $t_i$ and leak test pressure as $p_i$. 
With that, the model will be formulated as:-

$$
logit \left( \pi_i \right)  = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t_i + \beta_2 p_i
$$

```{r, model 1}
model_1 <- glm(formula = O.ring / Number ~ Temp + Pressure, 
               data = df,
               family = binomial(link = logit), 
               weights = Number)
summary(model_1)
cbind(Estimate = coef(model_1), confint(model_1))
Anova(model_1, test = 'LR')
```
The results of the likelihood ratio test, we see that temperature appears to be 
statistically significant predictor on the number of o-ring failures. It is also 
showing the inverse relationship between o-ring failure and the temperature. 
The pressure variable is not statistically significant predictor on the number 
of o-ring failures. 
The coefficient of $t_i$ was estimated to be 
`r cbind(Estimate = coef(model_1), confint(model_1))[2,1]` with the 95% Wald 
confidence interval of `r cbind(Estimate = coef(model_1), confint(model_1))[2,2]` 
to `r cbind(Estimate = coef(model_1), confint(model_1))[2,3]`, indicating that 
the decrease on the launch temperature would cause the increase on the odds 
for an O-ring to fail. 
In Anova test, involving feature variable of *Temp*, according to 
$H_0 : \beta_1 = 0$ and $H_\alpha : \beta_1 \neq 0$. 
The LRT statistic for *Temp* is `r Anova(model_1, test = 'LR')[1,1]` with a 
p-value of `r Anova(model_1, test = 'LR')[1,3]`. 
Using the Type I Error rate $alpha = 0.05$, we reject the null hypothesis and 
accept that the feature *Temp* is important to be included in the model with
other feature variable *Pressure* is included the model. 
For the test of *Pressure* with $H_0 : \beta_2 = 0$ vs. $H_\alpha : \beta_2 \neq 0$, 
The LRT statistic of *Pressure* is `r Anova(model_1, test = 'LR')[2,1]` with a 
p-value of `r Anova(model_1, test = 'LR')[2,3]`. Using the Type I Error rate 
$alpha = 0.05$, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. 
Therefore, there is a lack of evidence to include the feature variable *Pressure* 
to be included in the model. 

```{r}
test.temp <- -10
exp(test.temp*coef(model_1)['Temp'])
```
With 10 deg F temperature drop increases the odds o-ring failure by approximately 
`r abs(round(floor(exp(test.temp*coef(model_1)['Temp'])) - exp(test.temp*coef(model_1)['Temp']), 2)) * 100`%. 

In our next model, we are just including temperature as our explanatory varaible.
For a given launch $i$, we denote the probability for an O-ring to fail as $\pi_i$, 
launch temperature as $t_i$ . 
With that, the model will be formulated as:-

$$
logit \left( \pi_i \right)  = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t_i
$$

```{r, model 2}
model_2 <- glm(formula = O.ring / Number ~ Temp, 
               data = df,
               family = binomial(link = logit), 
               weights = Number)
summary(model_2)
cbind(Estimate = coef(model_2), confint(model_2))
Anova(model_2, test = 'LR')
```

In our second model, we just used temperature as the feature to predict the
probability of o-ring failure and it still appears to be statistically significant 
feature in predicting the probability of o-ring failure.

Dalal, Fowlkes, and Hoadley (1989) chose to remove *Pressure* from the model 
for the weak effect of it, but we also have limited data for 50 and 100 psi. 
And the interaction between *Temp* and *Pressure* was not taken into account by 
the authors. Given the fact that high pressure can cause "blow holes" in the putty, 
resulting the hot gasses to escape. If so, the effect of pressure can be 
significant predictor when the temperature is very low. Therefore, 
removing *Pressure* from the model could possibly cause serious information loss.

In our third logistic regression model, we use temperature and it's quadratic
term as explanatory features to predict the o-ring failure probability.
For a given launch $i$, we denote the probability for an O-ring to fail as $\pi_i$, 
launch temperature as $t_i$. 
With that, the model will be formulated as:-

$$
logit \left( \pi_i \right)  = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t_i + \beta_2 t_i ^ 2
$$

```{r, model 3}
model_3 <- glm(formula = O.ring / Number ~ Temp + I(Temp ^ 2), 
               data = df,
               family = binomial(link = logit), 
               weights = Number)
summary(model_3)
cbind(Estimate = coef(model_3), confint(model_3))
Anova(model_3, test = 'LR')
```
Then, we wanted to see if the quadratic temperature has any effect on predicting
o-ring failure and we do not see any statistical significance of it. So we are
not going to use this quadratic temperature feature in our model.

In our fourth logistic regression model, For a given launch $i$, we denote the 
probability for an O-ring to fail as $\pi_i$, launch temperature as $t_i$ and 
leak test pressure as $p_i$. We also consider the interaction term between
*Temp* and *Pressure*.
With that, the model will be formulated as:-

$$
logit \left( \pi_i \right)  = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t_i + \beta_2 p_i + \beta_4 t_i:p_i
$$

```{r, model 4}
model_4 <- glm(formula = O.ring / Number ~ Temp + 
                                           Pressure + 
                                           Temp:Pressure, 
               data = df,
               family = binomial(link = logit), 
               weights = Number)
summary(model_4)
cbind(Estimate = coef(model_4), confint(model_4))
Anova(model_4, test = 'LR')
```
```{r, predicted probability and o-ring failure with temprerature}

grid.arrange(p7, p8, ncol=2)
```

The confidence intervals gets wider in lower temperature for lack of training data 
at low temperature, leading the model to be more uncertain at lower temperatures.

When the temperature is 31째 F, the estimated probability of o-ring failure is 
`r round(temp_range[temp_range$Temp == 31,]['pi_hat'], 4)` with the confidence 
interval between `r round(temp_range[temp_range$Temp == 31,]['lower'], 4)` and
`r round(temp_range[temp_range$Temp == 31,]['upper'], 4)`). The estimated number 
of o-ring failures at 31 deg F is `r round(temp_range[temp_range$Temp == 31,]['pred_failures'], 4)` 
with the confidence interval between `r round(temp_range[temp_range$Temp == 31,]['failures_lower'], 4)`
and `r round(temp_range[temp_range$Temp == 31,]['failures_upper'], 4)`. 
In order to draw inference from the model, we need to assume the model is built 
off a representative data set including records with both high and low 
temperatures, high and low pressure levels. We should not be training the model
on a range and use for inference on another range. Then the results will be 
uncertain and we can not trust the model's predictions.

```{r, bootstrap-confidence-intervals}
o.ring.failure.estimator <- function(iterations, seed=42, number=6) {
  # Setting seed to make the plot exactly reproduced
  set.seed(seed)
  n <- 23 # Resample size
  estimation <- array(data = NA, dim=c(91, iterations))
  
  # Performing re-sampling repeatedly "b" times
  for(i in 1:iterations) {
    samples <- sample(x = 1:n, size = n, replace = TRUE)
    model   <- glm(formula = O.ring / Number ~ Temp, data = df[samples,],
                   weights = Number, family = 'binomial')
    # Performing prediction for 10-100째 Fahrenheit using each fitted model 
    preds <- predict(object = model, newdata = data.frame(Temp = 10:100),
                     type = "response")
    j <- 0

      j <- j+1 # Index

    }
  }

                   type = "response")
  i <- 0

    i <- i+1 # Index to locate data in the data.frame
    # Getting the 90% CI and multiply by 6 to get estimation for a single flight
    ci <- quantile(estimation[i,], probs = c(0.1, 0.90), names=FALSE)
    incidents[i, 1] <- i + 9 # Temperature
    incidents[i, 2] <- p*number
    incidents[i, 3] <- ci[1]*number
    incidents[i, 4] <- ci[2]*number
  }

  return(incidents)
}

# Performing predictions for 10째-100째 temperature and plotting the result
predicted.incidents <- o.ring.failure.estimator(2000)
```

```{r, plot bootstrap confidence interval}

  xlab("Temperature in degree fahrenheit") +
  ylab("Expected number of incidents") -> p9

# Using grid to make the plot smaller to take up less room.
grid.arrange(p9)
```

We are simulating the sampling(with replacement because of small data size) 
process over iterations and performed model fitting using the sample, generated 
in each iteration and used it for prediction and calculation of confidence
interval for different temperature values.
We are running the simulation 2,000 times to generate a stable distribution. 
The confidence interval varies depending on the temperature value. At lower 
temperature, the confidence interval tends to get wider as it moves further away 
from the center of the data, resulting the uncertainty of the model predictions.


2.  Dalal, Fowlkes, and Hoadley (1989) chose to remove `pressure` from the model based on their likelihood ratio tests. Critically evaluate, using your test results and understanding of the question and data, whether `pressure` should be included in the model, or instead, `pressure` should not be included in the model. Your report needs to make a determination, argue why it is most appropriate choice, and make note of how (if at all) the model results are affected by the choice of including or excluding `pressure`.

## Confidence Intervals (20 points)

No matter what you determined about using or dropping `pressure`, for this section begin by considering the simplified model $logit(\pi) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Temp$, where $\pi$ is the probability of an O-ring failure. Complete the following:

1.  Estimate the logistic regression model.
2.  Determine if a quadratic term is needed in the model for the temperature in this model.
3.  Construct two plots:
4.  $\pi$ vs. Temp; and,
5.  Expected number of failures vs. Temp.

Specific requirements for these plots:

-   Use a temperature range of 31째 to 81째 on the x-axis even though the minimum temperature in the data set was 53째.\
-   Include the 95% Wald confidence interval bands for $\pi$ on the plot. Describe, in your analysis of these plots, why the bands much wider for lower temperatures than for higher temperatures?

3.  The temperature was 31째 at launch for the Challenger in 1986. Estimate the probability of an O-ring failure using this temperature, and compute a corresponding confidence interval. Discuss what assumptions need to be made in order to apply the inference procedures.

## Bootstrap Confidence Intervals (30 points)

Rather than relying on asymptotic properties, consider using a parametric bootstrap, as did Dalal, Fowlkes and Hoadley. To do this:

1.  Simulate a large number of data sets (n = 23 for each) by re-sampling with replacement from the data.
2.  Estimate a model for each dataset.
3.  Compute the effect at a specific temperature of interest.

To produce a confidence interval, the authors used the 0.05 and 0.95 observed quantiles from the simulated distribution as their 90% confidence interval limits.

Using the parametric bootstrap, compute 90% confidence intervals separately at each integer temperature between 10째 and 100째 Fahrenheit.

In this section, you should describe your process, justify such a process, and present your results in a way that is compelling for your reader.

## Alternative Specification (10 points)

With the same set of explanatory variables in your final model, estimate a linear regression model. Explain the model results; conduct model diagnostic; and assess the validity of the model assumptions. Would you use the linear regression model or binary logistic regression in this case? Explain why.

```{r, linear model}
model.linear <- lm(O.ring ~ Temp, data = df)
summary(model.linear)

par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(model.linear)
```

According to the linear model, the Temperature is statistically significant and 
negatively related to the number of O-ring failures for a given flight. 
For every 1-degree Fahrenheit increase, the number of O-ring failures decreases 
by `r model.linear$coefficients[2]`.

The residuals vs fitted plot displays non-linear relationship, which can not be 
explained by the linera model and contributed in the residuals. 
In the Q-Q plot, the residuals are supposed to follow a straight line showing 
that the data is normally distributed, but it deviates from that pattern 
with a curve, which might be the result of skewness of data. 
The scale-location plot displays if there is an equal variance (homoscedasticity), 
we see that in our case, the residuals are not randomly distributed, and that's 
why the smooth red line is not horizontal. 
The Residual vs Leverage plot shows us that if there are influential observations. 
All the observations are within Cook's distance lines, with an outlier 
observation data point 14 which is at the borderline. We can conclude that it 
does not show any influential cases that can alter the slope coefficient 
significantly if removed.
