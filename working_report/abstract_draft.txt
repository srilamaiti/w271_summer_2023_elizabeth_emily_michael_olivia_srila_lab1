After the 1986 Challenger Launch failure, the Rogerâ€™s commission was tasked with investigating its cause, and concluded that an analysis of past launches would have yielded a correlation between O-ring performance and temperature. This conclusion is explored and verified in the paper Risk Analysis of the Space Shuttle: Pre-Challenger Prediction of the Future by Siddhartha Dalal, Edward Fowlkes, and Bruce Hoadley. Here, we utilized the same data-set as Dalal et al to better understand the conclusions of their analysis. We begin by exploring the data as-is to identify key features that we later include in our initial binomial logistic regression model. From there, we run various tests to better understand the significance of each key feature, as well as quadratic transformations of these features. Lastly we attempted to predict probability of O-ring failure with a linear model, interpret the results, and determine whether these results are valid. Ultimately, we found that a binomial logistic regression model predicting probability	of O-ring failure using only temperature was most reliable. This model predicts that there was 81% chance of O-ring failure at the time of the Challenger launch, with 95% confidence intervals between 16% and 99%.
